# Where is the Custom Learning web part?

When Custom Learning is provisioned in your organization, the Custom Learning SharePoint site and web part are added to your organization’s SharePoint tenant. As part of the provisioning, the Custom Learning web part is added to the following pages of the Custom Learning Web site:

- Start-with-Six-Simple-Steps.aspx 
- Recommended-Playlists.aspx
- Get-started with-Office 365.aspx
- Get-started-with-Microsoft-Teams.aspx
- Get-started-with-OneDrive.aspx
- Get-started-with-SPO.aspx

For each page, the Web part is configured differently to show the categories and playlists designed to support the intent of the page. The Custom Learning web part, as we’ll show you later, can be filtered to show specific categories, playlists, or assets. Let's take a look. 

## View Microsoft Teams playlists

Here’s an example of the Get Started with Microsoft Teams page with the Web part filtered to show the learning playlists for Teams.
