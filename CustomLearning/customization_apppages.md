# SharePoint Application Pages for Custom Learning

Custom Learning for Office 365 features two application pages you should be aware of as an administrator. These are non-editable SharePoint pages.

- **CustomLearningAdmin.aspx** – provides Administrative features for Custom Learning, including hiding and showing content and creating and editing subcategories and playlists. We’ll cover this page and its functionality in more detail in later topics.

•	CustomLearningViewer.aspx – provides a Viewer page for displaying Custom Learning contents. For example, if you copy a Playlist link and share it with a co-worker, the link, when clicked, takes the user to the Viewer page and displays the linked content.

There are several kinds of customizations that are available to the owners of this site. 

- [Customize web pages](#customizing-web-pages)
- [Customize available services](#customize-available-services)
- [Customize and share playlists](customplaylist.md)

Some or all of these customizations can be completed before you launch the site to your user community.  

> [!TIP]
> Gather feedback from your employees and periodically complete additional customizations.  Add playlists, target webpages to specific roles or turn on new training content when launching new services. 

## Customizing web pages

You can fully customize the Custom Learning web site. If you are not familiar with creating pages within modern SharePoint Online sites we suggest you review [Customize your SharePoint site](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/customize-your-sharepoint-site-320b43e5-b047-4fda-8381-f61e8ac7f59b) article on support.office.com. 

### Customize the **Ask Questions and Get Help** page

As a starting point for customizing the site, select Ask questions and get help from the menu bar, then click the SharePoint Edit button and change the images and the links.
