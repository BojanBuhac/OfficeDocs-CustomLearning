- To install the Custom Learning site package for your tenant you will need to have Office 365 Administrative permissions.  If you do not have these permissions you can either work with your Office 365 Administrator or install the webpart alone for an individual site collection.
- You may want to consider installing the package in a testing location to get familiar with the content.  If you take this approach you will need to reinstall the package in your production tenant and recreate any customizations that you completed during testing. 
- Updates to the webpart training content will not effect your page customizations.
