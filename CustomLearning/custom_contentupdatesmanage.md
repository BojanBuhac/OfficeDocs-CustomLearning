# How learning content updates are applied
The Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways catalog is automatically updated on a quarterly basis. The catalog content, which is a set of JSON metadata, is stored in a global cache within an organization's tenant. The global cache is automatically updated when a learning pathways Site Collection Administrator or Owner opens the Learning Pathways Administration page. For more information, see Managing Content Updates. 

## Access the learning pathways Administration page

The learning pathways Administration page is the central controlling point for administration of the Microsoft 365 learning pathways web part. Only Administrators will have the ability to open the Administration page from the SharePoint **Home** menu item.  

### To access the Learning Pathways Administration page
- From the Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways Home page, click the **Home** menu, then click **Learning Pathways administration**. When an Admin loads the Administration page, the global cache is updated and the updated content is now available to learning pathways users in the organization. 

## What if there's content in the updates you want to hide?
Check the list of content updates [Manage Content Updates](custom_contentupdatesmanage.md). If there's content you want to hide from users, you can hide it by Subcategory or Playlist. You can also hide content by Technology. For instructions on how to hide content, see one of the following:
