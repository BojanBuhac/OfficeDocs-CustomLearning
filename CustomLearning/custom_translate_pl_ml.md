# Translate a learning pathways custom playlist
If you've created learning pathways custom playlists for your site, you can translate the playlists into the languages you enabled for the site. 

1.	From the Learning Pathways **Home** menu, click **Learning pathways administration**. 
2.	Click the custom playlist you created earlier. In this example, we'll use **Five Simple Steps - Welcome to Contoso**. 
3.	Click **Edit Detail**, then in the **Add language** box, select a language. In this example, we'll use **Italian – Italy**. 
5.	Click **Save Detail**. 
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Translator notifications are not built into custom playlists. Translators will need to be notified manually. 


## Translate the assets in the custom playlist
Any assets in a playlist that are supplied by Microsoft will not require translation. But if you’ve added custom assets from your tenants SharePoint site, those assets will require translation. Earlier in this scenario, you created a custom asset for the Five Simple Steps playlist. Now you’ll translate that asset in the playlist to Italian.
1.	Under **Assets**, select the **Edit** icon next to the custom asset. 
2.	In the **Add language** box, select **Italian**, and then click **Save Asset**.
3.	Click the custom playlist.
4.	Click a language, and then click **Open Page**. 
5.	Click **Translation**, **Create** for the languages you want, and then View. 
6.	Use Bing Translator to translate the text and copy it to the page. 
7.	Click **Publish**. Your page should now look like this. Copy the URL for the page.  
8.	Return to the **Learning pathways administration** page. 
9.	Click the edit icon to edit the custom asset.
10.	Click a language - in this case **Italian – Italy**, enter the copied url, and then click **Save Asset**. 
11.	Scroll up the page and click **Close Playlist**.
