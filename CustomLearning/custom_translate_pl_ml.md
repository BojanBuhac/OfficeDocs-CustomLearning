> Translator notifications are not built into custom playlists. Translators will need to be notified manually. 

## What does a translator do?
Translators manually translate the copies of the default language page into the language(s) specified. You will need to notify the translator of the translations required for playlist details. It's recommended that you finish all playlist changes,including adding, editing, or deleting playlist assets, then notify the translator of the required translations.

## Translate the assets in the custom playlist
Any assets in a playlist that are supplied by Microsoft are not editable and do not require translation. If you’ve added custom assets from your tenant's SharePoint site, those assets will require translation. Let's take a look at how to translate a custom asset in a playlist.

### Add a language for an existing asset
1. Under **Assets**, select the **Edit** icon next to the custom asset. 
2. Select a language from the **Add language** box, and then select **Save Asset**.

### Add a language page for an existing asset
1. In the asset list, click the English asset, and then click **Open**.
2. On the top bar, select **Translation**.
3. From the language dropdown, select the language for the asset, select **Create**, and then **View**. Your page should now look something like this.

4. Click **Publish**, and then copy the URL for the page. It should look something like this, with the language code in the URL.
https://tenantname.sharepoint.com/sites/M365LP/SitePages/it/Welcome-to-Contoso.aspx.
5. Return to the SharePoint Administration page, add the URL for the language for the asset, and then click **Save**.
