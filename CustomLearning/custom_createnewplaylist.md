# Creating new playlists

When creating a new playlist, you can add existing Custom Learning assets from Microsoft or you can add new assets such as the SharePoint page covered in the Create SharePoint pages for playlists section. Typically, when creating a new playlist, you first create a series of SharePoint pages, and then go to the Custom Learning Administration page to add the pages to a playlist. 

**Create a new playlist** 

1. From the Custom Learning Home page, click Office 365 training, select the system menu from the Web part, and then select Administer Playlist. 
2. Select a subcategory. In this example, select First Days.
