# Customize the Training Experience

By default both the site experience and the webpart include content for all Office 365 services.  If only all or some of these services are available in your company you can adjust what content is available to your users.  

First we will customize the content available in the webpart itself.  This information is applicable to a stand alone webpart installation or using the webpart inside of the Custom Learning site experience. 

## Customizing the training content


Go to Start with six simple steps
- From the Home page, click Start with six simple steps. 
- You see the Office Training page with the Custom Learning web part routed to the Start with six simple steps playlist.
