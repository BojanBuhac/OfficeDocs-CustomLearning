# Hide and show Technology

In some cases, you’ll want to hide content for a technology that’s not supported in your organization. The Hide Technology feature is designed to prevent technology from appearing throughout the Web part. It offers a broader way to hide and show content than hiding it by subcategory or playlist. For example, you can hide a Yammer subcategory, but Yammer may still show up in certain scenario playlists such as "Connect your organization with Yammer". To ensure a specific technology is not exposed to end users, you can hide it by Technology. 

## Hide a Technology

1. From the Microsoft 365 learning pathways **Home** page, click the **Microsoft 365 training** tile.
2. From the Custom Learning Web part, select the **System** menu, then select **Administer Playlist**. You should now have two tabs open. One with the **Custom Learning Administration** page, and one with the **Microsoft 365 training** page. 
3. From the **Custom Learning Administration** page, click a **Technology**, and then select the eyeball for the Technology to hide it. For this example, click the **Yammer** technology, and then hide it.

### Verify the playlist is hidden

2. Click the **Recommended** subcategory. You'll notice that the Connect your organization with Yammer playlist is hidden.
