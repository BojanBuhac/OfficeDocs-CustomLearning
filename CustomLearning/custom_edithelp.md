# Customize the Custom Learning site

The Custom Learning site is based on a SharePoint communication template. The template is relatively simple and you can customize the site pages to meet your organization's needs. For example, you can change the site name, logo, menu items, and content on the pages. If you need help customizing a communication site, see **link here**. 

## Customize the Ask questions and get help page

1.	From the Custom Learning Home page, click Ask questions and get help.
2.	Click the Edit button.
3.	Hover over a Help option button, then click Edit web part.
