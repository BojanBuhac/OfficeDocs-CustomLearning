# Customize the site

The Custom Learning site is based on a SharePoint communication template, so it's easy to modify the site to meet the needs of your organization. You can change the site name, logo, menu items, and the content on the pages. 

> [!TIP]
> Gather feedback from your employees and periodically complete additional customizations.  Add playlists, target webpages to specific roles or turn on new training content when launching new services. 

## Custome web pages

You can fully customize the Custom Learning web site. If you are not familiar with creating pages within modern SharePoint Online sites we suggest you review [Customize your SharePoint site](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/customize-your-sharepoint-site-320b43e5-b047-4fda-8381-f61e8ac7f59b) article on support.office.com.
