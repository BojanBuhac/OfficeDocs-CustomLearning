# Setup options for multiligual learning pathways
Learning Pathways provides the following options for setting up multilingual support.
- Provision a new multilingual learning pathways site – if you don’t already have a learning pathways SharePoint site, then this is your best option. With this option, you provision the fully translated learning pathways SharePoint template and Web part in 9 languages. To get started with this option, see <Provision a new multilingual learning pathways site>.
- Upgrade an existing learning pathways site for multilingual support – If you already have an existing Learning Pathways site in use, you can enable it for multilingual support and then translate the site for the languages you want to support. To get started with this option, see <Upgrade an existing learning pathways site>. 
- Manual install of the learning pathways Web part to a SharePoint Communication site. With the manual install, you use a PowerShell Script to set up learning pathways in a SharePoint communication site that does not use the learning pathways site.
