# Setup options for multiligual learning pathways
Learning Pathways provides the following options for setting up multilingual support.
- **Provision a new multilingual learning pathways site** – if you don’t already have a learning pathways SharePoint site provisioned in your tenant, then this is your best option. With this option, you provision the fully translated learning pathways SharePoint template and Web part in 9 languages. Note that if you provision a new learning pathways site in a tenant where it's already provisioned, you risk losing any customizations made to the previously provisioned site. For instruction to provision a new learning pathways site, see [Provision a new learning pathways multilingual site](custom_provision_ml.md).
- **Update an existing learning pathways site for multilingual support** – If you already have an existing learning pathways site in use, you can update it for multilingual support and then translate the site for the languages you want to support. To get started with this option, see [Update learning pathways for multilingual support](custom_update_ml.md). 
- **Manual install of the learning pathways Web part to a SharePoint Communication site** - With the manual install, you use a PowerShell script to set up learning pathways in a SharePoint communication site other than the learning pathways site. This path is TBD.
