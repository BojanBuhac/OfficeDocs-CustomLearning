# Drive Adoption of Your Learning Portal

Drive adoption of your Custom Learning experiences with these simple steps and tools. 

We understand that training solutions are only as good as the usage they receive in your organization.  That's why we've created these simple steps and templates to help you drive awareness and adoption of our tools. Start with these steps after you have configured the site template in your SharePoint Online environment.

Download the Custom Learning Success Kit. This kit includes:

- Email template
- Posters for printing
- PowerPoint slides

The email templates and PowerPoint slides can be customized with your own language and logos.  

The following best practices can help you increase usage of the site in your organization.  

## Connect learning to other business outcomes

You will have the best results when the launch of the Custom Learning experience is incorporated in any other service deployment or upgrade projects.  This will give your employees a clear reason to visit the site.  Examples might be an upgrade of SharePoint Online or deployment of Microsoft Teams.  You can include phrases like:

"To learn more quick tips about <Insert service name here> visit our Custom Learning portal for Office 365." 

## Align the training site to investments in your employee learning 

Work with your human resources team to align the launch of your training portal with any other employee training initiatives that are being implemented in your company. 

## Use our Success Kit resources

Download our [launch kit](/embeds/custom_learning_launch_kit.zip) to print and post our flyers and posters.  Edit and send our launch email to yoru employees to give them 3 simple steps to getting started with the portal.  

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to edit the launch email to include the proper web address (URL) for your particular installation of the custom learning portal.
