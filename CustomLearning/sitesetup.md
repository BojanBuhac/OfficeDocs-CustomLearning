Configuration instructions:
Your pre-configured training and adoption site is now ready for your customization and use. This page will provide you with information about what to do to make this site most useful to your company.

Review each drop-down navigation menu. You may want to remove pages from the navigation that outline services you are not using. By removing the item from the navigation, you are leaving the page content intact in the Site Pages library. If you decide to use those services in the future, the content will be there for you to return to the navigation. 
Edit page content to reflect internal policies. If your organization does not allow for off-site access to resources or mobile applications, remove those references in the documentation. Any edits to pages will be respected by future updates to the template. New versions of original pages will be copied to your Site Pages library but your edited pages will remain intact. You may also add additional pages for other tools you have in your environment. New pages will not be impacted by any future template updates. 
Add links to your internal help or support desk experiences. These links can go anywhere within the site content. Consider adding them to the Getting Started and Training sections. 
Add links to your user communities. Bringing enthusiastic people together in a champion program or community is one of the most powerful things you can do to drive productivity in your company.  
Have questions or suggestions? Engage with the Custom Learning for Office 365 User Voice forum to make your voice heard.
