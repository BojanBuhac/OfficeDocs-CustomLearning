Why would one use it?                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| They wouldn’t, they can leave it blank, or mark it partner, or whatever… I use it internally by setting it to Tenant for all the custom content customers add that way the UX knows that anything not marked “Tenant” as a Source is not editable. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| @mike .. added information about some new things we’ve put in the manfiest.json… the AssetOrigin being the key one, this is how we would ensure we can properly resize the iFrame for the partners content.                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Ack that I’ve seen this. Albeit a few months down the road…                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                   |
