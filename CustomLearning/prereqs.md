# Getting Started

Custom Learning for Office 365 will allow you to provide on-demand training solutions for your organization.  Here we will discuss the pre-requisites and decisions you will need to make for a successful deployment.

The following instructions outline how to provision Custom Learning for Office 365 (CLO365), including the installation of the CLO365 communication site template and the Custom Learning web part, into your tenant environment. These instructions cover the installation of CLO365 via the SharePoint Online Provisioning Service at https://provisioning.sharepointpnp.com    If you are interested in installing just the Custom Learning web part for use on an existing SharePoint Online communication site, please refer to the instructions for [installing the custom webpart](installwebpart.md). 

## Prerequisites
 
To successfully install CLO365 via the [SharePoint Online Provisioning Service](https://provisioning.sharepointpnp.com) you must meet the following pre-requisites: 
 
- The individual that will be provisioning CLO365 must be the tenant administrator of the target tenant for install.  
- A tenant 'App Catalog' must be available within the 'Apps' option of the SharePoint Admin Center. If you do not have an app catalog currently refer to the [SharePoint Online documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/use-app-catalog) to provision this feature.  
- The individual that will be provisioning CLO365 must be a site collection owner of the app catalog in the target tenant for install. If the CLO365 installer is not a site collection owner of the app catalog [complete these instructions](addappadmin.md) and continue.
