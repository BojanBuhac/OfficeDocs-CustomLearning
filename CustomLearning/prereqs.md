# Getting Started
Custom Learning for Office 365 provides the flexibility to set up the solution in a couple different ways. The following sections outline the options available.

## Provision with the PnP Provisioning Service - Recommended
The PnP Provisioning Service provides the fastest, easiest, and recommended method for setting up Custom Learning. With the PnP Provisioning Service, an Office 365 tenant admin signs into the site, makes a few choices, and clicks **Add to Tenant** to provision the SharePoint Online Custom Learning Site, and the Custom Learning Web part. When provisioning is done, the Tenant Admin receives an email that the site is ready to go. 

- To get started with the SharePoint Provisioning Service, go to [Provision with the PnP Provisioning Service](installsitepackage.md)   

## Manual installation of the Custom Learning web part
For organizations that already have an established SharePoint Online modern communication training portal, Custom Learning provides the option to manually install the Custom Learning Web part into an existing SharePoint Online site. Note that the site must be a modern SharePoint Online site. This method requires Tenant Admin permissions and experience with Windows PowerShell or the SharePoint Online Management Shell. 

- For Manual web part installation instructions, see see [Manually install the web part](installwebpart.md). 

## Upgrade Custom Learning
Organizations that may have participated in a Custom Learning Pilot Program, or already have Custom Learning provisioned, can follow the instruction provided the [Provision with the PnP Provisioning Service](installsitepackage)    

- For Manual web part installation instructions, see see [Manually install the web part](installwebpart.md).
