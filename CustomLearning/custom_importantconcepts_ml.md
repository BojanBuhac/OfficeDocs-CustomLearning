# Important concepts for learning pathways multilingual support 
Before you start translating the learning pathways site, it’s important to understand a few key concepts of how the multilingual feature works with learning pathways. 
- The SharePoint pages and news can be seen and translated in the English language profile – for example, the Admin role when the language option is selected. 
- Site information - Navigation, logo, site name require that the site is viewed in the foreign language profile and performed by the translator in their language of origin.
- The learning pathways Web part must be viewed in with associated language profile for it to appear in a non-English language.

## Try this demonstration
1. From the learning pathways site Home page, click Microsoft 365 training.
2. In the upper-right corner of the page, select the language. In this example, Italian is selected.
