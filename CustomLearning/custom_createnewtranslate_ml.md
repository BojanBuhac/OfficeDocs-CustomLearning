# Create a new page and translate it
When you provision learning pathways from the SharePoint look book site, the SharePoint site pages are already translated. However, when you create a new page, you will need to manually translate the page to the supported languages. In this example, we’ll create a page in the default language of English and then add a translation page in Italian. 

## Create a page
1.	With the English language selected from the learning pathways site, click **+ New > Page**. 
2.	Select **Blank** > **Create Page**.
3.	Name the page **Sample Page**.
4.	Click **+** > **Add a new web part** in column one. 
5.	Select the **Microsoft 365 learning pathways** web part. The page should now look something like this. <graphic here...>
6. Click **Sample Page**.
 
## Add the web part
1.	Click **+** > **Add a new web part** in column one. 
2.	Select the **Microsoft 365 learning pathways** web part. The page should now look something like this. 

## Filter the Web part
1. Click the Web part to filter it
2. Click the filter (pencil) button. 
3. Filter to the **Microsoft Teams** subcategory. 
4. Close the **Edit** pane and publish the page.

## Add a language for the page
•	From the Sample page you just created in English, click Translation, click Create for a language, and then View. 
•	From the Translation page, do one of the following:
o	Create for all languages if you are supporting all languages 
-or-
o	Select Create for the language you want to support.
•	You see a “Draft saved a few seconds ago.” message. Click View. 
•	You can click Publish. When you publish the page the designated translator is notified of the changes. This is covered in the Translator section later in this guide. 

## Translate the page in the supported languages
When you modify a page, it must also be modified in the supported languages. This is the role of the translator. If you've specified a translator in Language settings, they'll be notified when you publish the page in English. For now, you can play the role of translator. For more information for setting up a foreign language account, see [Set up a foreign language account].

1. Navigate to the page that requires translation. In this case, it's the page you just modified. 
2. Copy the English text in the page title and get the translation from Bing Translator. Remember, this is just a simulation.

3. Select a language from the language dropdown. In this example, we select Italian. The Italian page is now displayed, but the changes made in the English version will need to be translated for the Italian version of the page.

4. Hover over the **Microsoft 365 training** tile, and then click **Edit details**. 
5. As an example, change the **Formazione su Microsoft 365** to **Formazione su Contoso**. You can use Bing Translator as you become familiar with the SharePoint multilingual feature. 
6. Republish the page. 
7. Repeat Steps 2-6 for as many languages as you have supported for the site.

NOTE: Unless you are running the site with a non-English language profile, the Web part, Site title, and navigation will appear in English. When you modify a page, you modify it in the default language. The default language for Learning Pathways is English. When you publish the page, translators, if you selected them, are notified that the page is available for translation.
