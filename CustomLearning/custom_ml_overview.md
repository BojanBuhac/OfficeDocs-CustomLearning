# Multilingual support for learning pathways

If your organization spans a diverse population, you can make Microsoft 365 learning pathways available in multiple languages. Learning pathways currently supports 9 languages, with English as the default language. The supported languages include:   

- English	 
- Chinese (Simplified)
- French
- German
- Italian (Italy)
- Japanese (Japan)
- Portuguese (Brazilian)
- Russian (Russian)
- Spanish

Multilingual support for learning pathways is supported by the SharePoint Online multilingual feature for SharePoint Online communication sites.

## Get familiar with the SharePoint Online multilingual feature
Before you start working with multilingual support for learning pathways, you should become familiar with how multilingual support works for SharePoint communication sites. With multi-lingual support, you can provide translated pages, news posts, and user interface elements like site navigation, title, and description in the user's preferred language. 
- To get familiar with the multi-lingual feature, see [Create multilingual communication sites, pages, and news](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/2bb7d610-5453-41c6-a0e8-6f40b3ed750c). 

## What you need to know before you get started
Before you get started setting up multilingual support for learning pathways, it's important to understand some key concepts regarding how multilingual support works for learning pathways. 

- Some functionality is introduced gradually to organizations that have opted in to the Targeted Release program. To determine if the Targeted Release program feature is enabled in your tenant, see [Set up the Standard or Targeted release options](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/3b3adfa4-1777-4ff0-b606-fb8732101f47). 
- Page translation features are available on SharePoint communication sites only.
- Pages are not translated automatically. Each page created in your default language can have a corresponding page in a chosen target language that you, or someone you assign, manually translates. After you translate such a page and publish it, it will automatically be displayed to users in the language specified in their user profile.
- Fresh installs of learning pathways from the SharePoint look book site provide a fully translated SharePoint site in 9 languages. SharePoint provides the ability to remove the languages you don't want to support in your organization. You can also turn off the multilingual feature for an English-only site. 
- English is the default language for learning pathways. The learning pathways administration page is English-only. 
- Changes to the original source page or to other translation pages are not automatically synced with all translation pages. Each translation page must be updated manually.
- The language of content displayed to a user will depend on their personal language and region settings. For more information about setting up a User Profile for Language and Region, see <...>. 
- Site navigation, title, and description must be translated by a person with a user profile in the language to be translated.
- The learning pathways Web part is displayed in the language of the user profile of the person viewing the site. 

- To get started, see [Multilingual setup options for learning pathways ](custom_goto.md).
