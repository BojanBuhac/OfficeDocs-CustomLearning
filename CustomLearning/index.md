## Self service, customizable training from Microsoft

Custom Learning for Office 365 is a new solution from Microsoft designed to speed training and adoption of Office 365 within your organization. Custom Learning provides a customizable SharePoint communication site, a Custom Learning SharePoint web part, and a connection to an up-to-date online catalog of Microsoft learning content.

With Custom Learning for Office 365, organizations can:

- Tailor learning and adoption content for their environment
- Hide or show content to reflect the services supported in their organization
- Keep learning content up-to-date with a live feed of content from Microsoft
- Build custom playlists crafted specifically for your user's needs

Custom Learning currently features training for Office 365, with an emphasis on the end-user audience.  If you'd like to see more content included, give us [suggestions and feedback](feedback.md) in our online forum.  

## Streamlined provisioning of Custom Learning

**Option 1**: [The Custom Learning SharePoint Online Site Package](installsitepackage.md)

Custom Learning can be easily provisioned from the SharePoint Patterns and Practices Provisioning Service. When provisioned, you get a SharePoint Online communication site designed to be an out-of-the box training portal for your company. Formerly known as Toolkit for Teamwork, this training portal can be customized to add your organization's help, support, and community content. You can also remove any content related to services not supported within your organization. 

Along with the SharePoint site, the provisioning service also installs a Custom Learning Web part. Connected to an online catalog of Microsoft content, the Custom Learning Web part can be dropped on any SharePoint page and configured to support

**Option 2**: [The Custom Learning for Office 365 web part ](installwebpart.md)
The Custom Learning web part option is designed for organizations that want to integrate Office 365 training into an existing SharePoint Online communication site. The Custom Learning web part can be installed on any SharePoint Online page and provides an up-to-date feed of the full suite of Office 365 training content from Microsoft's Support.Office.com site. Training content delivered through the web part is organized in easy-to-consume playlists. Administrators can also use the web part to build custom training playlists, combining content from YouTube, locally hosted content like .PDFs, and Office 365 training content, to provide training experiences tailored to the unique needs of the organization.
