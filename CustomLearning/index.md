- An online catalog of Microsoft content - Custom Learning is connected to an online catalog of Microsoft training content
- A SharePoint Online communication site - Custom Learning provides an easy-to-provision training portal that can be customized to the needs of your organization.
- a SharePoint web part - Custom Learning provides a SharePoint web part that can be filtered to present targeted training content. Organizations can also use the Web part to create their own custom playlists.

## Streamlined provisioning 

Custom Learning can be provisioned from the SharePoint Patterns and Practices Provisioning Service. When Custom Learning is provisioned, organizations get a SharePoint Online communication site designed to be an out-of-the box training portal, along with a Custom Learning Web part connected to an onlinne catalog of training content. 

## Additional Resources
You can use the Custom Learning site experience to provide links to any new or existing user community forums. Consider starting an internal user group, if you don't have one already, to enable people to share their success and learn from each other.  If you don't have time to nurture an internal user group, you and your employees can join the [Microosft Office 365 Champion community](https://aka.ms/O365Champions) for monthly training, membership in the online community, and early access to tools and resources for Office 365.
