## Playlist navigation
Based on customer feedback, we've made navigation more obvious with Next and Previous buttons. We've also added a table of contents within the navigation area to enable users to easily see the full list of items and navigate directly to an asset.

## Copy a Playlist
Many customers have expressed the need to modify just a few simple things in a playlist. For example, just remove one assets and replace it with another. A common request was to remove a step from 6 simple steps. Now you can copy a playlist from an existing playlist. For example, you can now copy six simple steps, delete 3 steps, and turn the playlist into 3 simple steps.
