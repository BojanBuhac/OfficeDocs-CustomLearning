# Familiarize yourself with the solution experience
Get started with the learning pathways experience by following the three steps outlined below. With the three steps, you can build a compelling demo that you can use for engaging presentations with customers.

## 1. Create a Microsoft 365 demonstration environment
You can use demos.microsoft.com to create a demo environment where you can provision the service, validate it, and use it for presenting learning pathways to customers. All partners have access to https://demos.microsoft.com for these purposes. You can use the demos.microsoft.com **Getting Started Guide** if you are new to tthe demo environment.

## 2. Provision Microsoft 365 learning pathways
You can provision learning pathways with the SharePoint Online Provisioning Service.
- To provision learning pathways, go to the [Microsoft 365 learning pathways](https://provisioning.sharepointpnp.com/details/3df8bd55-b872-4c9d-88e3-6b2f05344239) solution page. - - Review the [Learning pathways setup options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/customlearning/custom_setupoptions). 
- Review the [Solution Prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/customlearning/custom_provision) – as these are common impediments for customer new to SharePoint who may not have all the correct permissions or necessary environment configuration in place, such as a tenant app catalog.
- Try to deploy the solution via a non-Administrator role – to familiarize yourself with the provisioning service error-handling and email service.

## 3. Explore your newly provisioned learning pathways site to get familiar with its capabilities
- Go to the [Admin Success Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/customlearning/custom_successcenter) - either in the solution or online. In addition to learning about content and feature updates, you'll find planning, customization, adoption, and measuring impact guidance.
- Use the [Customizing learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/customlearning/custom_overview) guidance in the Admin Success Center to customize the site. You'll want to understand the customization capabilities so you can demo them for customers. For example, hide subcategories and playlists. Create custom playlists, or create landing pages with a filtered learning pathways web part to drive a learning campaigns. 
- Create a sample learning pathways communication campaign based on the [downloadable Adoption Kit](https://teamworktools.azurewebsites.net/m365lp/m365lpadoptionkit.zip). You can highlight the custom content you've created and demostrate how it ties into a learning campaign that drives adoption.
