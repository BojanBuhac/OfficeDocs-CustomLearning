## Translate the site title, description, and navigation
To show the site name, navigation, and footer of your site in the different languages you've made available, each must be translated manually. For example, if youâ€™ve made changes to the site title, description and navigation of the site in English, a user with Spanish as their preferred personal language manually edits and translates the title, description, navigation into Spanish. A user with German as their preferred personal language does the same for German. Once the content is translated, it will display for all users of those preferred languages. 

- For more information about how site title, description, and navigation are translated, see [Set up a multilanguage site name, navigation, and footer](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-multilingual-communication-sites-pages-and-news-2bb7d610-5453-41c6-a0e8-6f40b3ed750c#bkmk_muitranslations).
