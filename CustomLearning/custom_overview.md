# Customize the Learning Experience

Introducing Custom Learning for Office 365, a new solution from Microsoft designed to speed the usage and adoption of Office 365 within an organization. With Custom Learning, you can:
- Tailor Office 365 learning and adoption content for your environment 
- Hide or show content to reflect the services or features supported in your organization 
- Keep your content and users current with an up-to-date feed of learning content from Microsoft 
- Build custom playlists and categories crafted specifically for your user's needs

## How does Custom Learning work?

Custom Learning for Office 365 (Custom Learning for short) consists of three parts: 
1. a live feed of content from a Microsoft online catalog
2. a SharePoint communication site
3. a SharePoint web part
