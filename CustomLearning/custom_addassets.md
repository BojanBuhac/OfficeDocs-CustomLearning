# Add assets to a custom playlist

With Custom Learning, you can add the following assets to a playlist:

- **Existing Custom-Learning-supplied assets** - these are assets that are part of the Microsoft online catalog. 
- **New assets** - thease are assets that you add to Custom Learning that are built from SharePoint pages the you create or SharePoint assets that are already available on a SharePoint site in your organization. 

> [!TIP]
> You can't modify the Custom Learning playlists supplied by Microsoft, but you can add Microsoft-supplied assets to a custom playlist. If a Microsoft playlist asset doesn't meet your needs, create a new playlist and then add the Microsoft assets and any newly created assets to the playlist. 

## Create a new asset for a playlist

To add new assets to a Custom Learning playlist, you can specify the URL of a SharePoint page or you can create a new asset page directly from the Custom Learning user interface. For this example, we’ll enter the URL of a previously created SharePoint page.  

1.	If the playlist isn't open for editing, from the Custom Learning Administration page, click the playlist you wish to edit. 
2. To add a new asset to a playlist, click New Asset. 
3. Enter a title, in this example “Custom Playlist Introduction”, and then click Enter URL.

5. Click Save Asset. 

## Add an existing asset to a playlist

Existing assets consist of Microsoft-provided Custom Learning assets or assets that have already been added to Custom Learning by your organization. 

1.	If the playlist isn't open for editing, from the Custom Learning Administration page, click the playlist you wish to edit. 
2. In the Search box, enter a Search phrase, and then select an asset from the Search results. In this example, enter “What is Excel?” to add an Excel intro topic to the playlist.
