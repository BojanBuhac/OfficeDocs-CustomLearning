# Modify and translate a page
The learning pathways SharePoint site pages are translated into nine languages. When you make a change to an English source page, the changes are not syncronized with the additonal language pages. Translations must be done manually. 

## Edit a multilanguage page
1.	From the learning pathways **Home** page, click **Microsoft 365 training**.  
2.	Click **Edit** in the upper-left corner of the SharePoint site. 
3. In the page banner, click **Edit web part**, then change the text Title text to something like Microsoft 365 training for <your Company name>, then and then close the **Title Region** pane. 
3.	Click **Publish**.

## Translate the page in the supported languages
When you modify a page, it must also be modified in the supported languages. This is the role of the translator. If you've specified a translator in Language settings, they'll be notified when you publish the page in English. For now, you can play the role of translator. For more information for setting up a foreign language account, see <Set up a foreign language account.>

1. Navigate to the page that requires translation. In this case, it's the page you just modified. 
2. Copy the English text in the page title and get the translation from Bing Translator. Remember, this is just a simulation.

3. Select a language from the language dropdown. In this example, we select Italian. The Italian page is now displayed, but the changes made in the English version will need to be translated for the Italian version of the page.

4. Hover over the Microsoft 365 training tile, and then click Edit details. 
5.	Change the Formazione su Microsoft 365 to Formazione su Contoso. You can use Bing Translator as you become familiar with the SharePoint multilingual feature. 
6. Republish the page. 
7. Repeat Steps 2-6 for as many languages as you have supported for the site.

NOTE: Unless you are running the site with a non-English language profile, the Web part, Site title, and navigation will appear in English. When you modify a page, you modify it in the default language. The default language for Learning Pathways is English. When you publish the page, translators, if you selected them, are notified that the page is available for translation.
