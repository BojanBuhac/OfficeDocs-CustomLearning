# Test your translations 
After you’ve modified the learning pathways site, you can test the translation work you’ve done with a foreign language user profile. If you haven’t set up a foreign language user profile, see the “Create foreign language user profiles and set site permissions” section covered earlier in this exercise. Translators with non-English profies should click through the pages and playlists, including any custom playlist, to ensure pages, navigation, footers, have been successfully translated.
