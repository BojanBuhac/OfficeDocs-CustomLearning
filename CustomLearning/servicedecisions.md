## Service Decisions

Once your pre-requisites are met and prior to installation you should make the following decisions about your implemenation of CLO365:

1. **Do you already have a training portal in your company with a modern interface?**

- **YES** If your answer to these questions are yes, then [installing the webpart](installwebpart.md) within that existing site experience is our recommended course of action.
- **NO** If you answer no we suggest [installing the full Custom Learning site](installsitepackage.md) package.  This will prepare you with a modern SharePoint Online communication site that your can expand to house other information that is important to your end users.  Customizing the site will not impact the webpart's ability to get content updates. 

2. **Are you an Office 365 Administrator?**

- **YES**:  You have the appropriate rights for either installation.
- **NO**: Contact your Office 365 Administrator for assistance or install the webpart in a site collection you own

3. **Do you have a formal training department in your organization?**

- **YES**:  Make sure to engage them and let them know how they can use these solutions to deliver additional, customized training content.
- **NO**:  Use our [self service adoption kit](driveadoption.md) to make your end-users aware the site is available to help them.

4. **Do you have a user community in your organization?  This would be either a formal or informal group of users who like to know more about technology, sometimes called power users or just those interested to learn more.**

- **YES**:  You can use the Custom Learning site experience to provide links to any new or existing user community forums.
- **NO**:  Consider starting an internal user group so people can share their success and learn from each other.  If you don't have time to nurture an internal user group you and your employees can join the [Microosft Office 365 Champion community](https://aka.ms/O365Champions) for monthly training, membership in the online community and early access to tools and resources for Office 365.

5.  **Will you be accountable for site maintenance or support questions?**

- **YES**: We suggest using the capabilities of Office 365 to make Custom Learning site support easier.  Some ideas, depending on your service subscription and organization size are:
    1. Large organizations can provision a public Yammer community to get feedback on the site
    2. Up to 2500 people can join a Microsoft Team to ask questions and share conversation
    3. A formal support ticketing process can be suppored with Forms, Flow and SharePoint Online lists or through other 3rd party tools which you may already have for IT support in your company. 
- **NO**:  Discuss the installation of the site/webpart with your IT staff who provide SharePoint Online support.
