# November 2019 Version 3.0 Feature Updates
Based on customer feedback, the following new features have been added to Learning Pathways version 3.0.

## Content Updates and Editorial Calendar
One of the promises of learning pathways is up-to-date content. To this end, we've provided our first quarterly content update. The content update is reflected our Content Update article which will be updated on a quarterly basis. For content updates, see [Learning pathways Content Updates](custom_contentupdates.md)

## Microsoft 365 Success Center
We've added a Microsoft 365 learning pathways Success Center to help Admins and Site Collection Owners get the most out of learning pathways. The Success Center provides links to planning and adoption resources and offers guidance on planning, customizing, driving adoption,and measuring impact of learning pathways. For more information, see [Learning pathways Admin Success Center](custom_successcenter.md)

## Playlist navigation
Based on customer feedback, we've made navigation more obvious with Next and Previous buttons. We've also added a table of contents within the navigation area to enable users to easily see the full list of items in a playlist and to navigate directly to an asset in a playlist.

## Copy a Playlist
Many customers have expressed the need to modify just a few simple things in a Microsoft-supplied playlist, without the need to create a completely new playlist. For example,a common request is to remove a step from the Start with Six Simple Steps playlist. Now you can copy a playlist from an existing playlist, including a playlist from the Microsoft catalog,and then modify that playlist. For example, you can now copy six simple steps, delete 3 steps, and turn the playlist into 3 simple steps. For more information, see [Copy a playlist](custom_copyplaylist.md)

## Improved Search capabilities 
Search capabilities when building a playlist from the Administration page have been improved. Search results provide additional details to distinguish duplicate names in Search returns. You can also click on a Search results item to preview the asset. For more information, see [Create a custom playlist](custom_copyplaylist.md)
